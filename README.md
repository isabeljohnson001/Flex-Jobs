# Flexjobs

This project is a full-stack job search platform designed to connect job seekers with potential employers. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for the frontend interface, and it uses a Java Spring Boot backend with MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.

## Features

- **For Job Seekers**: Users can browse job listings, filter by categories, and apply directly.
- **For Employers**: Employers can post job vacancies, manage applications, and search for candidates.
